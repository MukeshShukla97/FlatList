# Honeycomb Example

Hello there, developer!  Another dev on the team has just completed the basic structure for our new app, including redux, reduxForm, and react-navigation.  Your task is to create a `Field` component that fits into the `FormScreen` and allows you to select one of the `options` available in the `props`.

* The component should allow one item to be selected at any given time.
* The component should have the first item selected initially.
* The component should work with reduxForm

Good luck to you!
